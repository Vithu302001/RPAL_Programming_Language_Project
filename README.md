## The RPAL interpreter project for CS 3513 involves creating a lexical analyzer, parser, and CSE machine for the RPAL language. Developed in Java, it includes:

### Lexical Analyzer: Tokenizes RPAL code.
### Parser: Constructs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from tokens.
### Standardizer: Converts AST to a Standardized Tree (ST).
### CSE Machine: Executes ST to evaluate expressions.
#### Key classes include LexAnalyser, RPAL_parser, Standardizer, and CSEMachineFactory. The interpreter reads command-line arguments to process files and flags for AST, ST, or execution.
